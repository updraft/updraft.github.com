<p>
Updraft is a university project that aims to create user-friendly open source application for glider flight planning and visualization.
Features will include visualization of 3D maps, flight planning and visualizations of recorded IGC files, all of that on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X
In short what SeeYou does, but much cooler and for free.
